# PYD Builder for Python 3.11 on Windows x64

**A template package for building Windows Python extension modules (`.pyd`)
using GNU tools (MinGW/GCC) inside conda — no administrator rights required.**

Compile Python (via Cython), C, or C++ sources into importable `.pyd` modules on
one machine for use on any other Windows machine with a Python 3.11.* environment.  The use of GNU tools instead of Microsoft Visual Studio build tools or extension eliminates any need for administrator credentials or admin-only installable tools.

---

## Quick Start

```powershell
# 1. Create + activate the build environment (one-time — see REBUILD.md for the
#    required compiler shim step)
conda create -n py_pyd_modern -c conda-forge python=3.11 libpython gcc_win-64 gxx_win-64 cython
conda activate py_pyd_modern

# 2. Put your Python source in src/ (filename = module name)
#    Then build:
.\build.ps1

# 3. Your compiled .pyd is in compiled/. Try the included example:
python example_usage.py
```

**First time?** Read [REBUILD.md](REBUILD.md) — the environment needs a one-time
compiler shim to work.

> ⚠️ **Compiled modules require CPython 3.11.x specifically.** See
> [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md).

---

## Why This Exists

On Windows, Python normally expects the MSVC toolchain (VS Build Tools) to build extensions, which always requires admin rights to install. This template uses **conda** to provide a complete, modern **GNU toolchain (GCC 15.2, UCRT)** plus the Python import library, all installed at the user level without the need for administrator credentials.

---

## Requirements

**Summary:** conda, Windows x64, and **CPython 3.11.x** for running compiled modules.

See **[REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md)** for the complete specification,
including the strict Python-version rule and build vs. runtime requirements.

---

## Environment Setup

Full setup — including the **required compiler shim** — is documented in
**[REBUILD.md](REBUILD.md)**. Read that first.

Environment definitions live in **[env/](env/)**:
- `env/environment.yml` — portable recipe (`--from-history`)
- `env/py_pyd_modern_lock.yml` — exact lockfile (all resolved versions)

## How the Build Config Finds Your Compiler

The build and IntelliSense configuration is **portable by design** — it uses
the `CONDA_PREFIX` environment variable rather than hardcoded paths, so it
works on any machine without editing.

**This means the following MUST be true for it to work:**

1. You have created the conda environment (see [REBUILD.md](REBUILD.md) and
   [env/](env/)) with the GNU toolchain packages.
2. **That environment is ACTIVATED** before you build or open the project —
   activation is what sets `CONDA_PREFIX`:
   ```powershell
   conda activate py_pyd_modern
   ```
3. The compiler shims (`gcc.exe` / `g++.exe`) have been applied inside the
   environment (one-time step — see [REBUILD.md](REBUILD.md)).

If IntelliSense can't find `Python.h`, or the build can't find `gcc`, the most
common cause is **the conda environment is not activated** (so `CONDA_PREFIX`
is unset or points at the wrong environment).

> **VS Code note:** If IntelliSense doesn't resolve after activating the env,
> select the conda interpreter (*Python: Select Interpreter*) and reload the
> window (*Developer: Reload Window*) so VS Code picks up `CONDA_PREFIX`.

---

## Build Workflow

1. **Add your source** to `src/`. The **filename becomes the module name**, so
   name it what you want to `import` (must be a valid Python identifier).
   Drop multiple `.py` files in `src/` and each becomes its own `.pyd`.
   ```
   src\python_module.py   →   import python_module
   ```

2. **Build:**
   ```powershell
   conda activate py_pyd_modern
   .\build.ps1
   ```

3. **Collect** the compiled `.pyd` from **`compiled/`**.

---

## Try the Included Example

The repo ships with a pre-built example module. Run:

```powershell
python example_usage.py
```

This imports the compiled example `.pyd` from `compiled/` and calls its
functions — demonstrating the full flow from source to importable module.

---

## Distributing a C++ .pyd Outside the Environment

C++ modules depend on GNU runtime DLLs (`libstdc++-6.dll`,
`libgcc_s_seh-1.dll`) that live in the build environment. To run a C++ `.pyd`
on a machine without the environment:

```powershell
.\bundle_dlls.ps1 compiled\your_module.cp311-win_amd64.pyd
```

This creates a `dist/` folder containing the `.pyd` and its required GNU runtime
DLLs. Copy the whole `dist/` folder to the target machine and run from within it.

> **Basic helper:** For pure Cython/C modules this is **usually unnecessary**, they
> need only `python311.dll` present wherever Python 3.11 runs. For
> production-scale distribution, consider a dedicated tool like `delvewheel`.
> Note that the target machine still requires **CPython 3.11.x** (see [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md)).

## Project Structure

```
src/          Sources to compile (filename = module name)
compiled/     Deliverable .pyd output (the example .pyd is committed here)
build/        Transient build artifacts — regenerated each build (gitignored)
dist/         Bundled distributable output from bundle_dlls.ps1 (gitignored)
env/          conda environment definitions (recipe + lockfile)
docs/         Guidance documents
.vscode/      IntelliSense configuration
build.ps1     Build script (compiles, then moves .pyd to compiled/)
bundle_dlls.ps1    Bundles a C++ .pyd's runtime DLLs into dist/
setup.py      Build recipe (Cython + setuptools; compiles all src/*.py)
example_usage.py   Demonstrates importing the compiled module

## Key Things to Know

- **A `.pyd` is locked to CPython 3.11.x** — it will only import into Python
  3.11 (any patch). See [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md).
- **Never rename a compiled `.pyd`** to change its module name — the name is
  baked into the binary. Rename the **source** file and rebuild instead.
- **Keep all work inside the conda env.** Do not build in an MSYS2 shell or
  against system Python — it causes ABI mismatches.
- **This is Windows x64 specific.** A `.pyd` built here will not run on Linux or macOS.
